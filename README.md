# Exploring Obesity Trends in the United States and Their Impact on Theme Parks

### Premise
Obesity, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Weight that is higher than what is considered healthy for a given height is described as overweight or obesity. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a screening tool for overweight and obesity.”. According to the CDC, if a person’s BMI is 30 or higher, that person would be considered obese. The waist circumference on average of an obese male is more than 40 inches and a non-pregnant female is more 35 inches. With the ride restrictions mentioned above, therefore the prevalence of obesity can be a good indicator of problems in accommodating guests on attractions.


### Problem Statement
<div align="center">What is the trend of the prevalence of obesity in the United States?</div> 
<div align="center">Is there a relationship between obesity and other health related categories such as life expectancy, physical activity?</div>
<div align="center">How could the trends of the prevalence of obesity impact theme parks? </div>

### Data 
The data being used for this project comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The data is composed of statistics for each county in the United States of America on the prevalence of obesity for the years 2001,2009, and 2011. The data also has the prevalence for sufficient physical activity for the years 2001, 2009, 2011 and has the life expectancy for 1985-2010. This data set will be used to explore the trend in obesity from 2001-2011 and explore the relationship between obesity, physical activity, and life expectancy. The data is also broken up by gender for each feature as well.
